# Operating system_project
Sudesh Sharma is a Linux expert who wants to have an online system where he can handle student queries. Since there can be multiple
requests at any time he wishes to dedicate a fixed amount of time to every request so that everyone gets a fair share of his time. He will
log into the system from 10am to 12am only.  He wants to have separate requests queues for students and faculty. Implement a strategy for
the same. The summary at the end of the session should include the total time he spent on handling queries and average query time. 

#Strategy

  within 120 minutes Mr. Sharma have to handle query of students as well as faculty members. So, Mr. Sharma will apply a strategy in which he will make two separate queues. One for student queries and other for faculty queries. As any student can have a small as well as a long list of doubtful questions or queries. So, when Mr. Sharma designed his online system, he decides to give equal amount of time to each and every student. By this he will be able to  allocate equal time share to each student. In case, if any student have a small query, he will not have to eait for long. While in case of faculty members Mr Sharma should plan to solve query according to the designation (priority) of faculty. If faculty member of higher designation comes with query that should be solved before any other query.
